# 🧠 Real-Time Engagement Detection with MediaPipe & OpenCV

A Python-based project that detects human pose and face landmarks in real time to estimate **user engagement** using webcam feed. It interprets body language cues like **head tilt**, **shoulder posture**, and **alignment** to give basic but effective feedback like:

- 🟢 Highly Engaged  
- 🟡 Slouched – Low Engagement  
- 🔴 Appears Distracted

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔎 Real-time video capture with OpenCV  
- 🧍 Pose landmark tracking using `MediaPipe Pose`  
- 😶 Face mesh detection with `MediaPipe FaceMesh`  
- 🧠 Engagement estimation based on simple heuristics  
- 🖼 Live overlay with status and FPS info

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/engagement-detector.git
cd engagement-detector
````

2. **Install dependencies**

> ⚠️ Make sure your Python version is **between 3.8 and 3.10**, as MediaPipe does not yet support 3.13+

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
```

---

## 🧾 How It Works

* The webcam feed is processed in real-time.
* MediaPipe's `Pose` and `FaceMesh` models identify key landmarks.
* Heuristic rules interpret body language:

  * Large head tilt ➡️ **Appears Distracted**
  * Short shoulder distance ➡️ **Slouched - Low Engagement**
  * Balanced posture ➡️ **Highly Engaged**
* Feedback is displayed on the frame along with FPS.
